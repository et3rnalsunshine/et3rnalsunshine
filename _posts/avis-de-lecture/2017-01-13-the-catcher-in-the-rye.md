You'd think I'd had a "helluva" time reading this book, but this book made me wanna act like a "madman" sometimes, if you know what I mean.

I  really  tried  to  like  the  story,  I really  did.  Without spoiling it, it’s about this teenager who needs to be in the mood for pretty much anything he says he can do. Holden Caulfield is a depressed boy who hates movies (frankly, who doesn't like movies?!...), and thinks that everyone is pretty much a "phony" or a "sonuvab#$*h".

(Note to the potential reader: If you feel like reading in English to learn new vocabulary just fuggedaboutit). 

So our boy keeps interacting with a hell of a lot of phonies even though he says he hates them, he keeps missing and seeking their company.  He really does.  And  remaining  a  hypocrite himself,  he  criticizes  their  attitude  and  their  language.  He sure does.  (If you think I repeat myself a lot, just wait until you've read the book yourself!)

But of course, it wasn't all bad. I got something from it by the end, like really really by the end. "Goddam" it. 

"The catcher in the rye" is mentioned only once in the book and the image that illustrates it, it’s got a warm feeling around it.  That killed me.  I loved it. I really did.

Apart from that, my favorite character is Holden's sister. She's quite a character this little girl, she kills Holden with her adorableness and she kills me too. She really does.

On a serious note though, of course when you analyze the book you encounter the issues that are serious, such as teenagers and sex, homophobia, pedophilia. And what I liked about it is that, the writer shows it in such a subtle way which makes you pause and dig a little deeper.

Apart  from  that,  Holden  shares  the  same  fears,  insecurities  and  worries  we  all  experience during this period. Even though, he's such a phony and a pain in the ass. I gotta give the guy some credits. The end was nice. It really was.
