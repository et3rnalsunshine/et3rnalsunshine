  <p>You’d think I’d had a “helluva” time reading this book, but this book made me wanna act like a “madman” sometimes, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>I  really  tried  to  like  the  story,  I really  did.  Without spoiling it, it’s about this teenager who needs to be in the mood for pretty much anything he says he can do. Holden Caulfield is a depressed boy who hates movies (frankly, who doesn’t like movies?!…), and thinks that everyone is pretty much a “phony” or a “sonuvab#$*h”.</p>

<p>(Note to the potential reader: If you feel like reading in English to learn new vocabulary just fuggedaboutit).</p>

<p>So our boy keeps interacting with a hell of a lot of phonies even though he says he hates them, he keeps missing and seeking their company.  He really does.  And  remaining  a  hypocrite himself,  he  criticizes  their  attitude  and  their  language.  He sure does.  (If you think I repeat myself a lot, just wait until you’ve read the book yourself!)</p>

<p>But of course, it wasn’t all bad. I got something from it by the end, like really really by the end. “Goddam” it.</p>

<p>“The catcher in the rye” is mentioned only once in the book and the image that illustrates it, it’s got a warm feeling around it.  That killed me.  I loved it. I really did.</p>

<p>Apart from that, my favorite character is Holden’s sister. She’s quite a character this little girl, she kills Holden with her adorableness and she kills me too. She really does.</p>

<p>On a serious note though, of course when you analyze the book you encounter the issues that are serious, such as teenagers and sex, homophobia, pedophilia. And what I liked about it is that, the writer shows it in such a subtle way which makes you pause and dig a little deeper.</p>

<p>Apart  from  that,  Holden  shares  the  same  fears,  insecurities  and  worries  we  all  experience during this period. Even though, he’s such a phony and a pain in the ass. I gotta give the guy some credits. The end was nice. It really was.</p>
