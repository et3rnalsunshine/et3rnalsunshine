<article class="content content--publication">
  <p>First I was skeptical, especially about the writing style, it resembled a lot the kind of books that I run away from ; you know the kind that pretends to bring new aspects of wisdom only to bore you with superficial all done sentences that confuse depth with mumbo jumbo and simplicity with vagueness ?</p>

<p>I thought ; oh God, here’s another “Alchemist” (although I never read this one, I know all about the  enthusiasm it caused along with the weird trend that made people believe they magically acquired wisdom. There, you know what I think about this one now…).</p>

<p>I was annoyed by the repetitions, the writing style, the sometimes obsolete words. But then by the end -and I mean by the very last chapter, a little light started to twinkle… wise genuine words.</p>

<h3 id="spoiler-alert">SPOILER ALERT</h3>

<p>The story started with the inner investigation of a man who instinctively refused  to become a pupil of every master, who deeply believed teaching was a matter of personal work ; something that should burst from inside. And despite his ego and over confidence, followed his own intuition, only to end up confusing it with his sentiments and be dragged away from his path and search for truth and true wisdom, to finally get completely and for years, lost in the “joys” of life (might sound familiar for a lot of us).</p>

<p>By the end of the book our man learns that the focus that we put on our objective somehow blinds us from the truth and hinders us from seeing the answers that surround us all along. And when we are not focused on a specific goal, we cease to be limited by a restricted vision, and we are then freer to receive anything that previously eluded us.</p>

<p>Of course we go by the lesson that one should not flagellate oneself on one’s tragic past and shameful life style, if this is the step that has led to self-discovery and to rectify the inner balance. Peace and forgiveness go hand in hand. But the most important lesson of the book, in my opinion, is that one can free oneself of time (and consequently of hasty judgments) by the simple idea that the value of each thing is in its continuity, its transformation, its evolution.</p>
